Good:
* Seems that items are being given unique id's as compared to collections
* Can now call items without collection id

Bad and Notes:
* NEED to update api_docs.md
* Should add a GET call for all items
* Unneeded info in 'api/collections' call
    * created_by_id
    * created_on
    * modified_by_id
    * modified_on
* Notes on 'api/collections/<coll_id>' call
    * Unneeded info: modified_on
    * NEED TO ADD: collection_id
    * Also, if there is no cover_image then the field will be ""
* Notes on 'api/collections/<coll_id>/<item_id>' call
    * 'stories' is an array, each item in this array has its own id and includes item_id (which might not be necessary)
    * Unnecessary info in stories: created_by_id, created_on, modified_by_id, modified_on
    * if images, videos, or stories are empty, then they are present but array is empty: []
    * Currently video thumbnail image addresses are not included in video array, even though you can add an explicit thumbnail image on the admin portal
        * So either we should remove thumbnail option or add it to the video array - depends on whether or not vimeo has their own thumbnails
    * cover_image is not included in this
    * Add created_by_id, created_on, etc. in this item view
* Notes on 'api/items/<item_id>'
    * Does include cover_image, but if it's empty field will be: null
    * NEED TO ADD: created_by_id, created_on, modified... etc.
    * NEED TO ADD: video
