          <p>Peggy White Wellknown Buffalo had a vision to help, as she said, “the generations in front us to have an understanding and knowledge of their roots.” She went to her clam father and brother Leroy White and to the Crow Nation Chairperson Clara Nomee who both gave Wellknown Buffalo permission to fulfill her vision to re-acquaint the Crow Indian community with items that had long-ago been removed from the reservation. Chairman Nomee specifically gave Wellknown Buffalo written permission to access Crow Indian collections at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American Indian (NMAI) in 2001.</p>
          <p>Suzy Kelly helped Wellknown Buffalo recruit and arrange for Crow elders to visit the NMAI in Washington, DC. “The mission was for those people to come forward with knowledge to activate the medicine bundles. Our bundles are dying, because almost no one is left with instructions about how to activate them,” Wellknown Buffalo stated. </p>
          <p>Kelly and Wellknown Buffalo led seven trips to the NMAI between between 2001 and 2008. Wellknown Buffalo videotaped the elders as they examined and described the history and stories about the sacred and non-sacred items there. She said, “The bundles wanted to breathe. I prayed over each bundle and asked it permission to be opened.” For ten years, the videotapes of the elders’ encounters with the items sat at The Center Pole compound without seeing the light of day. Wellknown Buffalo and Kelly were concerned that Wellknown Buffalo’s vision would not come to fruition.</p>
          <p>In the summer of 2018, University of Delaware Professor Cindy Ott visited her friends at The Center Pole and happened to ask Wellknown Buffalo and Kelly if there was a material culture project that she and her graduate students could help them with.  It was a fortuitous question that led to the creation of the Crow Indian Virtual Archive and Museum. Wellknown Buffalo gave Ott permission to create CIVAM because she is an educator. She and Kelly were relieved that the items would no longer be in storage, but would be “used to educate others, to open up minds to what happened in our past. I would love to have my great-great-granddaughter learn about them in school. Lots of stories are now lost. This is for the future of our children. That is why this is important to me,” Wellknown Buffalo told Ott.</p>
          <p>The CIVAM is maintained by students, staff, and faculty at the University of Delaware Department of History and Museum Studies with support from the UNIDEL Foundation and in collaboration with The Center Pole on the Crow reservation in Montana. Access and restriction policies are indicated for individual items or collections. Please send queries to Professor Cindy Ott at cott@udel.edu who will direct or answer your questions.</p>
